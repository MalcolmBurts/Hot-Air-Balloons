  <h3> - Hot air balloon</h3>
  
  <p>Hot air balloon: 
             is an oldest type of flying machine. It has an envelope that holds heated air and, most often, a gondola or a wicker              basket underneath it which carries passengers. Hot air is lighter than cold which lifts the balloon.</p>
  
  <h3> - Gas balloon</h3>
  
  <p> Gas balloon: 
              is filled with a gas that is lighter than air - helium or hydrogen. Different balloons can be gas balloons, and this type        has a lot of subtypes.</p>
  
  <h3> - Cluster balloons</h3>
  
  <p>Cluster balloons:
              are clusters of helium-inflated rubber balloons which also can have gondola or a harness that carries a pilot. Cluster            balloons are controlled in flight by jettisoning or deflating balloons or by jettisoning the ballast.</p>
  
  <h3> - Hopper balloon</h3>
  
  <p>Hopper balloon: 
              (or just Hopper) is a small, one-person hot air balloon, very similar to standard hot air balloons but with one seat or a        harness. Because of their size, their flights last only 1 to 1.5 hours.</p>
  
  <h3> - Airship or dirigible</h3>

              is a type of a lighter-than-air steerable balloon that uses engines to move through the air. They can have rigid, semi-rigid      and non-rigid bodie.
