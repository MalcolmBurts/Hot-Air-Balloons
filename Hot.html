  <h3> - Hot air Balloon</h3>
  
  <p>Hot air Balloon: 
           Is an oldest type of flying machine. It has an envelope that holds heated air and, most often, a gondola or a wicker              basket underneath it which carries passengers. Hot air is lighter than cold which lifts the balloon.</p>
  
  <h3> - Gas Balloon</h3>
  
  <p> Gas Balloon: 
            Is filled with a gas that is lighter than air - helium or hydrogen. Different balloons can be gas balloons, and this type        has a lot of subtypes.</p>
  
  <h3> - Cluster Balloons</h3>
  
  <p>Cluster Balloons:
            Are clusters of helium-inflated rubber balloons which also can have gondola or a harness that carries a pilot. Cluster            balloons are controlled in flight by jettisoning or deflating balloons or by jettisoning the ballast.</p>
  
  <h3> - Hopper Balloon</h3>
  
  <p>Hopper Balloon: 
            (or just Hopper) Is a small, one-person hot air balloon, very similar to standard hot air balloons but with one seat or a        harness. Because of their size, their flights last only 1 to 1.5 hours.</p>
  
  <h3> - Airship or Dirigible</h3>

     <p>Airship or Dirigible:      
            Is a type of a lighter-than-air steerable balloon that uses engines to move through the air. They can have rigid, semi-rigid      and non-rigid bodie.</p>
  
  <h3> - Toy Balloon</h3>

  <p>Toy Balloon:
            Is a small balloon filled with air or helium used for child play, party decoration, and advertising. These balloons are made      of rubber, latex or foil and in many colors.</p>
  
  <h3> - Balloon helicopter</h3>
  
  <p>Balloon helicopter:
           Is a type of a toy balloon that has a plastic propeller. This propeller is hollow and leads air through each propeller blade     which makes propeller rotate.</p>
  
  <h3> - Solar balloon</h3>
  
  <p>Solar balloon:
           Is a balloon, usually made out of material that is light and black or dark balloon material, that gains buoyancy when the air     inside is heated by the sun's radiation.</p>
  
  <h3> - Fire balloon</h3>

  <p>Fire balloon:
           Was a type of balloon used by Japan during World War II. It was a hydrogen balloon which carried bombs.</p>
  
  <h3> - Research balloons</h3>
  
  <p> Research balloons:
           Are balloons that are used in scientific research. They carry instruments that do meteorological, atmospheric, astronomic,        and military research and are usually unmanned. Some of them were even used on other planets (Vega 1 and Vega 2 on Venus in 1984).</p>
  <h3> - Balloon rocket</h3>
    
    <p>Balloon rocket:
           Is a long and narrow toy balloon used to demonstrate physical principles and the functioning of a rocket.</p>
  
  <h3> - Barrage balloon</h3>
  
  <p>Barrage balloon:
           Is a non-rigid balloon tethered with metal cables, used to defend against aircraft attacks making the approach of airplanes         more difficult.
    
  <h3> - Observation balloon</h3>
  
  <p>Observation balloon:
           Were usually hot air balloons or blimps with a gondola that were used for intelligence gathering and artillery spotting.</p>
  
  <h3> - Ceiling balloon</h3>
  
  <p>Ceiling balloon:
           Is a type of meteorological balloon that is used to determine the height of the base of clouds above ground level. They are         filled with gas, and its ascent rate is known, so the height of clouds is determined according to the time the balloon needs until       it reaches the cloud.</p>
  
  <h3> - Balloon catheter</h3>
  
  <p>Balloon catheter:
           Is a balloon used in medicine. It consists of a soft catheter and a small inflatable balloon at its end. During a                   catheterization procedure balloon helps passage within the body.</p>

  <h3> - Angioplasty</h3>
    
    <p>Angioplasty:
           Is a surgical procedure in which very small balloons are inserted into blocked or partially blocked blood vessels near the         heart. Balloon, placed like that, is inflated to remove or compress arterial plaque.</p>
